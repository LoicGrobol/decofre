**De**tecting **C**oreferences for **O**ral **Fre**nch<a href="#foottext1" id="footnote1">¹</a>.

This was developed for application on spoken French as part of my PhD thesis, it is relatively easy
to apply it to other languages and genres, though.

## Installation

1. Install with pip

   ```console
   python -m pip install decofre
   ```

2. Install the additional dependencies

   ```console
   python -m spacy download fr_core_news_lg
   ```

## Running a pretrained model

Use `decofre-infer`, e.g.

```console
decofre-infer path/to/detector.model path/to/coref.model path/to/raw_text.txt
```

Its output is still rather crude and mostly meant for demonstration purpose.

## Training a model

### Downloading ANCOR

So far the only corpus we officially support (more in preparation, along with an easier bootstrap
procedure).

-  Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/LoicGrobol/decofre && cd decofre`
- Ensure you are in an environment where DeCOFre has been installed (to be sure that all the
  dependencies are correct)
- Run the bootstrap script `python -m doit run -f datasets/ancor/ancor.py`

### Actual training

Use `decofre-train`, e.g.

```console
decofre-train --config tests/sanity-check.jsonnet --model-config decofre/models/default.jsonnet --out-dir /path/to/an/output/directory
```

This will put a `detector.model` and a `coref.model` files in the selected output directory, that
you can then load in `decofre-infer`.

The `sanity-check` trainig config is, well, *a sanity check*, meant to see if DeCOFre actually
 runs in your environment and uses a tiny training set to make it fast. The resulting models
will therefore be awful. This is normal, don't be alarmed.

You probably want to substitute the config files for your own, see also ANCOR config files in
[datasets/ancor/](datasets/ancor). The config files are not really documented right now, but you can
take inspiration from the provided examples. See also `decofre-train --help` for other options.

**This is by no mean fast, you have been warned.**
